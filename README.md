## Get started

This project does not support OAuth2 authentication with Splitwise. To use it,
you can get a developer API key as follows:

1. Login and register a new application at
   [Splitwise](https://secure.splitwise.com/apps/new)
   - Use any value for the fields.
2. Create a new API key
3. Set an environment variable `SPLITWISE_ApiKey` with the value

Export all your account data by running the console application command
`export-all`:

```bash

## Build

The project requires the .NET 8.0 SDK.

To build, test and generate artifacts run:

```sh
# Build
dotnet run --project build/orchestrator

# (Optional) Create bundles (nuget, zips, docs)
dotnet run --project build/orchestrator -- --target=Bundle
```

## Release

Create a new GitHub release with a tag `v{Version}` (e.g. `v2.4`) and that's it!
This triggers a pipeline that builds and deploy the project.
